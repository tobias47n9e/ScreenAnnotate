# Screen Annotate

This is an early prototype of a screen annotation tool for Gnome desktop that works with Wayland and X. Screen Annotation is used for screencasts where things on the screen need to be highlighted. This is often used in educational videos.

# Current Status

The extension is usable but currently only draws points on a small debug canvas.

# Contributing

Any kind of contribution is welcome.
